- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  As a mobile application developer, my job for this project was to create a simple inventory tracking app for one of our clients. The requirements for it included having databases for both login information and inventory tracking, an intuitive login page, a grid for displaying all of the inventory items on one screen, the ability to add/remove items, as well as a way to increase/decrease the number for each item. This provides a way for businesses to track their inventory effectively, without the need for large-enterprise systems that cost a lot of money.
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  Not only did all of those functions need to be included in the app, but the UI also had to look appealing and user-friendly. To accomplish this, I avoided the use of vibrant, flashy colors, and instead went for a simpler, more modern design. I also tried to avoid cluttering the screens, because I know that can be frustrating for users, especially on mobile apps where the screen is already small.

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

  First, I had to figure out what the app actually needed to do. I figured out which functions it needed, and then created the UI based on what screens I would need to perform each function. Once I had the UI pretty much figured out, I started writing the code for the functions. It was almost like building a puzzle, I just went through each screen I had created, and wrote the code neccesary to piece everything together. I think doing it this way was good, because it allowed me to focus on one screen at a time, and once I completely finished one screen, I would go on to the next. Developing and testing small pieces of code at a time can be very effective in all types of application development, and that's definitely something I can apply to my career in the future.

  
- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

  Like I mentioned before, I tried to write the code for each screen and test them seperately, to ensure that each one worked by itself before putting them all together. This allowed me to verify that each screen was working by itself, so that when I put it together, I knew that any issues that came up would have to be something to do with the linking of the pages, not the pages themselves.
  
- Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  
  This was my first experience with mobile development, as well as my first time using Android Studio, so there were a lot of challenges throughout this project. I ended up having to do a lot of research for this, and one of the biggest challenges for me was figuring out how to get the UI to look right. Before this, I had never created a UI for my code before, so I wasn't used to having to take that into consideration when creating the application. Usually, if I'm just writing back-end code that doesn't have a UI, I don't have to care as much about it's put together, or how certain things interact with each other. But for a mobile app, thats crucial, because you have to link together all of the screen views, all of the buttons, all of the text boxes, etc. Having a UI makes things more complicated, but ultimately I think it makes it more fulfilling because you really get to see your code come to life.
  
- In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I think I did a good job with the layout of the app, and how the user flows through each screen. As someone who has used inventory tracking systems in the past for work, I knew it needed to be simple but still effective. I didn't feel the need to include any extra features that wasn't required, because that would just take up space and create a more cluttered environment. Instead, I wanted a simple design with only the features that the user needed to accomplish their goal of tracking inventory.
